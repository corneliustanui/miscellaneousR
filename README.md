## About the package

This package is an assortment of small but convenient functions for performing simple to complex tasks appertaining to data wrangling. Raw data often comes in wildly disorganised shapes and often requires little to massive clever transformations, some of which transformations are hard to imagine.

Therefore, this package documents some of the weirdest scenarios I have come across as a professional data manager/analyst, as most of my time is spent cleaning data into palatable formats that can then be fed into subsequent data pipelines, such as report generations, dashboards, and data-based applications/products.

## How to get the package

To download the development version of the package, run the command;

```{r}

devtools::install_github("corneliustanui/miscellaneousR")

```

Happy analytics!
